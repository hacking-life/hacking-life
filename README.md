- 👋 Hi, I’m @hacking-life
- 👀 I’m interested in Christianity, tech, and fun.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Linux (wget, curl, pwd, etc.), & Ethical Hacking (nmap, burp-suite, trying to learn metasploit lol, etc.) for fun.
- 🏫 But for School, my favorite subject is clear and logical Reasoning (or identifying fallacies).
- 📫 You can reach me on YouTube (#@CK!NG_LiFE), and on OpenSea (for NFTs) (hacking_life, https://opensea.io/hacking_life). I might get a Reddit account soon, and will then update this information.
- 🙎🏽‍♂️ Whoever you are, I would just like to let you know that God loves you, and that we should all do the right thing!!!
